Resources to help independent developers make money.

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Making money from your own code has never been easier, but it's still hard. Here, I try to curate a list of resources to help everyone interested in making money from their digital products get inspired and give it a try. Be it monetizing sideprojects, bootstrapping business ideas, etc.

Projects don't need to be big, actually, it's better if they are not, they just need to be profitable. They might provide a passive income after the initial bulk of work, and who knows, maybe even help you reach financial independence.

Going indie does have lots of lifestyle perks :)

All these resources might help inspire you and put you on the right track but in the end what matters is to **MAKE and TRY stuff**. So devour this content responsibly :)

Contributions are more than welcome.

**Notes:**

If [$], it means it's not free and probably means I haven't tried it but still decided to add it because of the several references.

<!-- In general, I'd be wary of the several paid content-like products specially targetted to indie devs, so unless you can prove their value I'd like to keep them off of this list as much as possible. -->

### Communities
- **[IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses)**

  Learn from profitable businesses and side projects. IndieHackers is probably the catalyst for this new wave of interest on making an independent income. It is a collection of interviews to successful developers about their products. IndieHackers has been especially interesting to follow since it's been an indie project itself. [Courtland Allen](https://twitter.com/csallen?lang=ca) has been very transparent about [how he built it](https://www.indiehackers.com/blog). The last news make one think that the forum/community will grow.

- **[Barnacl.es](https://barnacl.es/)**

  News for bootstrappers, not VC hackers. Hacker-News like forum. [Peter Bhat Harkins](https://twitter.com/pushcx) started it in early 2016 and I've found it of great value ever since. Also, it runs on [great software](https://github.com/jcs/lobsters), which is always a thing to appreciate!

- **[bootstrapped.fm Forum](http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/)**

  A forum for bootstrappers. Started in 2013 by [Ian Landsman](https://twitter.com/ianlandsman) and [Andrey Butov](https://twitter.com/andrey_butov) as a continuation to the now defunct [The Business of Software](http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz).
  
- **##passiveincome** on freenode

  [Matthew Mallard](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=matbram) created this channel on the freenode IRC network in early 2017 and it has been pretty active and growing ever since.
  
- **[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/)**

  News for hackers, mostly technology and entrepreneurship. Not specific to indie devs but a must for everyone interested in computer science, creating products and making money. A lot of indie devs lurking around. Started by [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg).
  
- **[ProductPeople.club](https://productpeople.club/)** [$]

  Exclusive community for indie makers run by [Justin Jackson](https://twitter.com/mijustin). Apparently there's a waitlist and I can't figure out how much is it. I'm not a member so I can't personally endorse it. Generally, I'm skeptic on products targetting indie makers but I still found it relevant to add this specific product because of cross references. Some people might find it interesting. Feel free to reference to reviews!

##### Other
- **[r/Entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/)** - Not exclusive to indies/bootstrappers but still with relevant content for us.
- **[Bootstrapped Slack](https://bootstrapped.slack.com)** - Slack that probably originated from the bootstrapped.fm forum. Not really moderated.
- **[r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/)** - Quite active
- **[Sideprojectxyz](https://sideprojectxyz.slack.com)** - Slack community for people working on their sideprojects.

### Talks

- [David Heinemeier Hansson at Startup School 08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CDXJ6bMkMY) by [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://twitter.com/dhh)

  Bootstrapping as the better alternative to VC funded startups.
  
- [Tyler Tringas on Storemapper and MicroSaaS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3d1asTrWUQ) by [Tyler Tringas](https://twitter.com/tylertringas)

  15 minutes filled with a lot of valuable information and insights where Tyler presents the concept of Micro-SaaS and tells us his story.
  
- [Bootstrapping Side Projects To Profit by Pieter Levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3nb_Qj3mRA) by [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio)

  Probably one of the most known indie hackers of the last couple of years talks about how to turn our sideprojects into profitable businesses. Very straight to the point, Pieter always provides a lot of insightful thoughts. By the way, don't get fooled by his lifestyle, his success is 500% work. 
  
- [Marketing for Minorities](http://businessofsoftware.org/2011/03/hello-ladies-patrick-mckenzie-at-business-of-software-2010-marketing-to-minorities/) by [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/patio11?lang=ca)

  Lightning 7 minute talk by one of the most respected indie developers. The point Patrick is trying to make, is that solo developers can target way smaller and niche markets which might have low competition and be very profitable from a solo business point of view.

### Posts

- [Iâ€™m Launching 12 Startups in 12 Months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) by [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio)

  The challenge that started it all for Pieter. It inspired me to do something similar. What matters is to create and ship a lot, learning in the process, until something is worth pushing further.

- [Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) by [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/patio11?lang=ca)

  Patrick has written over 500 posts and I have obviously not read all of them, but of the many I've read, I chose this one...

- [Running A Software Business On 5 Hours A Week](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/03/20/running-a-software-business-on-5-hours-a-week/) by [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/patio11?lang=ca)

  ...and this one too :D

- [Storemapper: Bootstrapped to $50,000/year in 2 years (with live metrics)](https://tylertringas.com/storemapper-bootstrapped-to-50000year-in-2-years-with-live-metrics/) by [Tyler Tringas](https://twitter.com/tylertringas)

  This is just an example of a business more than one would be happy with :-) Besides liking how Tyler shares his story building Storemapper, I think he always maximizes for valuable content.

- [Why You Should Do A Tiny Product First](https://unicornfree.com/2013/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first) by [Amy Hoy](https://twitter.com/amyhoy)

  This is the first of a series by Amy Hoy. I'll be honest, I don't even remember what this was about, just that I found it worth my time. Oh wait, yeah, Amy told me not to code, at least at first. I haven't still gotten there...

- [The Epic Guide to Bootstrapping a SaaS Startup from Scratchâ€Šâ€”â€ŠBy Yourself](https://medium.com/@cliffordoravec/the-epic-guide-to-bootstrapping-a-saas-startup-from-scratch-by-yourself-part-1-4d834e1df8c1) by [Clifford Oravec](https://twitter.com/cliffordoravec)

  Another series on what solo bootstrapping is about, with an offensive twist. 

- [How to get more customers](https://medium.com/product-people/how-to-get-more-customers-54f64220e430) by [Justin Jackson](https://twitter.com/mijustin).

  This is a bit of a too specific topic for this general selection of posts, but the hell, you need to read it before it's too late. Ok, I'm starting to sound marketingy :D 

- [Indie Startups: The Ingredients of Success](https://hackernoon.com/indie-startups-the-ingredients-of-success-74531fe3a019) by [fpgaminer](https://hackernoon.com/@fpgaminer)

  Numbers with meaning. fpgaminer analyzed all the products featured on IndieHackers, extracted some statistics and got to some conclusions. Worth reading it also for the approach.

##### Others
There's obviously a million posts on the topic. I'm sure this is not a good selection but it'll get you started. Here you can find some more:
