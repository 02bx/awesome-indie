Resources to help independent developers make money.

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Making money from your own code has never been easier, but it's still hard. Here, I try to curate a list of resources to help everyone interested in making money from their digital products get inspired and give it a try. Be it monetizing sideprojects, bootstrapping business ideas, etc.

Projects don't need to be big, actually, it's better if they are not, they just need to be profitable. They might provide a passive income after the initial bulk of work, and who knows, maybe even help you reach financial independence.

Going indie does have lots of lifestyle perks :)

All these resources might help inspire you and put you on the right track but in the end what matters is to **MAKE and TRY stuff**. So devour this content responsibly :)

Contributions are more than welcome.

**Notes:**

If [$], it means it's not free and probably means I haven't tried it but still decided to add it because of the several references.

<!-- In general, I'd be wary of the several paid content-like products specially targetted to indie devs, so unless you can prove their value I'd like to keep them off of this list as much as possible. -->

### Communities
- **[IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses)**

  Learn from profitable businesses and side projects. IndieHackers is probably the catalyst for this new wave of interest on making an independent income. It is a collection of interviews to successful developers about their products. IndieHackers has been especially interesting to follow since it's been an indie project itself. [Courtland Allen](https://twitter.com/csallen?lang=ca) has been very transparent about [how he built it](https://www.indiehackers.com/blog). The last news make one think that the forum/community will grow.

- **[Barnacl.es](https://barnacl.es/)**

  News for bootstrappers, not VC hackers. Hacker-News like forum. [Peter Bhat Harkins](https://twitter.com/pushcx) started it in early 2016 and I've found it of great value ever since. Also, it runs on [great software](https://github.com/jcs/lobsters), which is always a thing to appreciate!

- **[bootstrapped.fm Forum](http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/)**

  A forum for bootstrappers. Started in 2013 by [Ian Landsman](https://twitter.com/ianlandsman) and [Andrey Butov](https://twitter.com/andrey_butov) as a continuation to the now defunct [The Business of Software](http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz).
  
- **##passiveincome** on freenode

  [Matthew Mallard](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=matbram) created this channel on the freenode IRC network in early 2017 and it has been pretty active and growing ever since.
  
- **[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/)**

  News for hackers, mostly technology and entrepreneurship. Not specific to indie devs but a must for everyone interested in computer science, creating products and making money. A lot of indie devs lurking around. Started by [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg).
  
- **[ProductPeople.club](https://productpeople.club/)** [$]

  Exclusive community for indie makers run by [Justin Jackson](https://twitter.com/mijustin). Apparently there's a waitlist and I can't figure out how much is it. I'm not a member so I can't personally endorse it. Generally, I'm skeptic on products targetting indie makers but I still found it relevant to add this specific product because of cross references. Some people might find it interesting. Feel free to reference to reviews!

##### Other
- **[r/Entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/)** - Not exclusive to indies/bootstrappers but still with relevant content for us.
- **[Bootstrapped Slack](https://bootstrapped.slack.com)** - Slack that probably originated from the bootstrapped.fm forum. Not really moderated.
- **[r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/)** - Quite active
- **[Sideprojectxyz](https://sideprojectxyz.slack.com)** - Slack community for people working on their sideprojects.
