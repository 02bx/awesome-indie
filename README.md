Making money from your own code has never been easier, but it's still hard. Here, I try to curate a list of resources to help everyone interested in making money from their digital products get inspired and give it a try. Be it monetizing sideprojects, bootstrapping business ideas, etc.

Projects don't need to be big, actually, it's better if they are not, they just need to be profitable. They might provide a passive income after the initial bulk of work, and who knows, maybe even help you reach financial independence.

Going indie does have lots of lifestyle perks :-)

All this resources might help inspire you and put you on the right track but in the end what matters is to MAKE and TRY stuff. So devour this content responsibly :)

**Notes:**
If [$], it means it's not free and probably means I haven't tried it but still decided to add it because of the several references.

In general, I'd be wary of the several paid content-like products specially targetted to indie devs, so unless you can prove their value I'd like to keep them off of this list as much as possible.
